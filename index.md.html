  <h4 id="list-item-1">An Introduction</h4>
  <p>I am a current GIMM Student attending BSU.<br>
  	I have a real passion for the development behind apps and games.<br>
  	I enjoy everything that goes into the making of games and apps.<br>
  	The art, coding, team work, and everything else.<br>
  	Actually I'm just going to start putting dots now<br>
  	My goal is to one day make a game that everyone<br>
  	talks about and enjoys.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 id="list-item-2">What is GIMM?</h4>
  <p>GIMM Stands for "Games, Interactive, and Mobile Media."<br>
  	We spend a lot of time studying everything that goes into the<br>
  	development of games, interactive and mobile medias.<br>
  	GIMM reaches all corners of these topics from audio design, level design, <br>
  	art direction, and etc. This is to broaden our horizens and <br>
  	give us skills in many different subjects to increase our<br>
  	abilities to help obtain and maintain a professional job.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 id="list-item-3">What has GIMM taught me?</h4>
  <p>As mentioned in the paragraph above, GIMM has taught me <br>
  	a whole assortment of different skills.<br>
  	Our strongest learned skill is learning to code in multiple languages.<br>
  	This builds up our ability to adapt to new advancements in the <br>
  	industry and keep up with the latest and greatest technologies.<br>
  	GIMM also covers topics such as audio design, art design, animation, <br>
  	level design, game design theory, and much more.<br>
  </p>
  <h4 id="list-item-4">What are Artifacts?</h4>
  <p>My artifacts are representations of what I have learned<br>
  	and the skills I have obtained in my time with GIMM.<br>
  	My first few artifacts, developed in flash, demonstrate <br> 
  	my learning curve in just a year of using the program. <br>
  	You can see my progress from borrowing lots of code and using many <br>
  	if statements to learning how to optimally code and create things such as <br>
  	AI states.
